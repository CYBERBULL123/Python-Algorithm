## Memoization

**Definition**: Memoization is an optimization technique used to improve the efficiency of algorithms, particularly recursive algorithms, by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. It's a form of caching that trades off space for time, often resulting in significant performance improvements, especially for functions with overlapping subproblems or repeated computations. üìù

**Neat and Best Code (Fibonacci Sequence with Memoization)**:
```python
memo = {}

def fibonacci(n):
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    memo[n] = fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
    return memo[n]

# Example Usage:
n = 10
print("Fibonacci sequence up to", n, ":", end=" ")
for i in range(n):
    print(fibonacci(i), end=" ")
```

**Input**: A function with expensive recursive calls or computations.

**Output**: The result of the function for a given set of inputs.

**Implementation**:
1. Create a dictionary to store computed results (memoization table).
2. Check if the result for the given inputs is already cached in the memoization table.
3. If the result is found, return it from the memoization table.
4. If the result is not found, compute it and store it in the memoization table before returning it.

**Logic**: Memoization reduces the time complexity of recursive algorithms by avoiding redundant computations through caching previously computed results.

**Example**: 
- **Input Function (Fibonacci Sequence)**:
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
- **Output (Memoized Fibonacci Sequence)**: Fibonacci sequence up to 10: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34

**Use Case**: Memoization is used in dynamic programming, recursive algorithms, and other computationally intensive tasks to improve performance by avoiding redundant computations.
