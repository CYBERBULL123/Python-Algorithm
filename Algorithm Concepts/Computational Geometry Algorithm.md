## Computational Geometry Algorithm 

Computational geometry algorithms are algorithms used to solve geometric problems involving points, lines, polygons, and other geometric objects. Here are some common computational geometry algorithms:

1. **Convex Hull**:
   - Given a set of points in the plane, find the smallest convex polygon that encloses all the points.
   - Algorithms include Graham's scan, Jarvis march (gift wrapping), Quickhull, and Divide and Conquer.

2. **Closest Pair of Points**:
   - Given a set of points in the plane, find the pair of points with the smallest Euclidean distance between them.
   - Algorithms include the brute-force approach, divide and conquer, and sweep line.

3. **Line Segment Intersection**:
   - Given a set of line segments in the plane, determine whether any two segments intersect.
   - Algorithms include the sweep line technique, Bentley-Ottmann algorithm, and line sweep with plane sweep.

4. **Polygon Triangulation**:
   - Given a simple polygon, partition it into triangles by adding diagonals.
   - Algorithms include ear clipping, monotone partitioning, and Seidel's algorithm.

5. **Voronoi Diagram**:
   - Given a set of points (sites) in the plane, partition the plane into regions based on the nearest site for each point.
   - Algorithms include Fortune's algorithm, divide and conquer, and incremental construction.

6. **Delaunay Triangulation**:
   - Given a set of points in the plane, find the triangulation such that no point is inside the circumcircle of any triangle.
   - Algorithms include flipping edges, divide and conquer, and incremental construction.

7. **Binary Space Partitioning (BSP)**:
   - Given a set of geometric objects (such as polygons), partition the space into convex regions to facilitate efficient spatial search and visibility determination.
   - Algorithms include the BSP tree construction and traversal.

8. **Geometric Primitives**:
   - Algorithms for basic geometric operations such as point location, point-in-polygon testing, line intersections, and ray casting.
   - Algorithms include line-line intersection, point-line distance calculation, and polygon containment.

These are just a few examples of computational geometry algorithms, and there are many more algorithms and variations used for different geometric problems. The choice of algorithm depends on factors such as the specific problem requirements, the geometric objects involved, and the efficiency requirements.
