     | Minimum Spanning Tree 🌱 | Kruskal's Algorithm, Prim's Algorithm |

   - Types: DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, BFS explores all neighbor nodes at the present depth before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level, Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, and Bellman-Ford algorithm computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices.

**4. Dynamic Programming:**
   - Parts:

     |---------------|-----------------------------|
     | Standard 🌟   | Prim's Algorithm, Kruskal's Algorithm, Dijkstra's Algorithm |

   - Types: Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum.

**7. Backtracking Algorithms:**

   - Types: Backtracking algorithms incrementally build solutions, abandoning partial solutions that cannot be completed into a valid solution.

**8. String Algorithms:**
   - Parts:
   
     | Type          | Problems                     |
     |---------------|------------------------------|
     | Matching 🔍   | Brute Force, Knuth-Morris-Pratt Algorithm, Rabin-Karp Algorithm |
     | Subsequence 🧩 | Longest Common Subsequence   |

   - Types: String matching algorithms find occurrences of a substring within a larger string, while the Longest Common Subsequence problem finds the longest subsequence common to two sequences.

**9. Computational Geometry Algorithms:**
   - Parts:
   
     | Type          | Problems                     |
     |---------------|------------------------------|
     | Convex Hull 🌐| Graham Scan, Jarvis March    |
     | Closest Pair 👫| Closest Pair of Points       |
