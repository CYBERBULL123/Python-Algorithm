## Tabulation

**Definition**: Tabulation is an optimization technique used to improve the efficiency of algorithms, particularly dynamic programming algorithms, by storing the results of subproblems in a table and filling up the table iteratively from the smallest subproblems to the larger ones. Unlike memoization, which uses recursion, tabulation uses iteration to compute the results of subproblems bottom-up, without recursion. It's a straightforward approach that ensures all required subproblems are computed once and stored in a table for later use. ðŸ“Š

**Neat and Best Code (Fibonacci Sequence with Tabulation)**:
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    table = [0] * (n + 1)
    table[1] = 1

    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        table[i] = table[i - 1] + table[i - 2]

    return table[n]

# Example Usage:
n = 10
print("Fibonacci sequence up to", n, ":", end=" ")
for i in range(n):
    print(fibonacci(i), end=" ")
```

**Input**: A function with dynamic programming subproblems.

**Output**: The result of the function for a given set of inputs.

**Implementation**:
1. Create a table (list) to store computed results for subproblems.
2. Initialize the base cases in the table.
3. Fill up the table iteratively, starting from the base cases and moving towards larger subproblems.
4. Return the result from the table corresponding to the required subproblem.

**Logic**: Tabulation avoids recursion and computes results for subproblems iteratively, starting from the smallest subproblems and building up to the larger ones, ensuring all required subproblems are computed once and stored in the table.

**Example**: 
- **Input Function (Fibonacci Sequence)**:
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
- **Output (Tabulated Fibonacci Sequence)**: Fibonacci sequence up to 10: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34

**Use Case**: Tabulation is used in dynamic programming algorithms, such as the Fibonacci sequence, to efficiently solve problems by storing and reusing the results of subproblems in a table.
