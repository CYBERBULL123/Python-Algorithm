Here, We can start with some fundamental algorithms and data structures in Python. Here are a few to get us going:

1. **Sorting Algorithms:**
   - Bubble Sort
   - Selection Sort
   - Insertion Sort
   - Merge Sort
   - Quick Sort
   - Heap Sort

2. **Searching Algorithms:**
   - Linear Search
   - Binary Search
   - Depth-First Search (DFS)
   - Breadth-First Search (BFS)

3. **Data Structures:**
   - Arrays
   - Lists
   - Stacks
   - Queues
   - Linked Lists
   - Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees)
   - Graphs
