Graph algorithms are algorithms used to solve problems related to graphs, which are mathematical structures consisting of vertices (nodes) connected by edges. Here are some common graph algorithms:

1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - Explores as far as possible along each branch of a graph before backtracking.
   - Used for traversing or searching graphs, finding paths, and detecting cycles.
   - Implemented using recursion or a stack data structure.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - Explores all neighboring nodes at the present depth before moving to the next level of nodes.
   - Used for finding shortest paths in unweighted graphs, traversing trees level by level, and solving other graph problems.
   - Implemented using a queue data structure.

3. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**:
   - Finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights.
   - Uses a priority queue to select the node with the smallest distance from the source node at each step.
   - Suitable for finding shortest paths in road networks, computer networks, and other weighted graphs.

4. **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**:
   - Finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph, even in the presence of negative edge weights, as long as the graph does not contain negative cycles reachable from the source node.
   - Iterates over all edges in the graph and relaxes them iteratively to update the shortest distances.
   - Detects negative cycles in the graph.

5. **Kruskal's Algorithm**:
   - Finds a minimum spanning tree (MST) for a connected, undirected graph with weighted edges.
   - Builds the MST by greedily adding the shortest edge that does not form a cycle in the current tree.
   - Suitable for network design, such as designing road networks or computer networks.

6. **Prim's Algorithm**:
   - Finds a minimum spanning tree (MST) for a connected, undirected graph with weighted edges.
   - Grows the MST one vertex at a time by always selecting the shortest edge that connects a vertex in the MST to a vertex outside the MST.
   - Suitable for network design, such as designing road networks or computer networks.

7. **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**:
   - Finds the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph, including negative edge weights but no negative cycles.
   - Computes the shortest paths using dynamic programming and a 2D array to store intermediate results.
   - Suitable for finding shortest paths in dense graphs with relatively small numbers of vertices.

These are just a few examples of graph algorithms, and there are many more algorithms and variations used for different types of graphs and problems. The choice of algorithm depends on factors such as the structure of the graph, the weights associated with the edges, and the specific requirements of the problem being solved.
