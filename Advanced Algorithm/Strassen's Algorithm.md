## Strassen's Algorithm

**Definition**: Strassen's algorithm is an efficient algorithm used for matrix multiplication, which reduces the number of arithmetic operations required to multiply two matrices compared to the naive approach. It employs a divide-and-conquer strategy to recursively divide large matrices into smaller submatrices, perform fewer multiplications using clever formulas, and combine the results to obtain the final product. Strassen's algorithm has a better asymptotic complexity than the naive matrix multiplication algorithm, making it more efficient for large matrices. ðŸ§®

**Neat and Best Code**:
```python
import numpy as np

def strassen(matrix1, matrix2):
    if len(matrix1) == 1:
        return matrix1 * matrix2

    n = len(matrix1)
    mid = n // 2

    a11 = matrix1[:mid, :mid]
    a12 = matrix1[:mid, mid:]
    a21 = matrix1[mid:, :mid]
    a22 = matrix1[mid:, mid:]

    b11 = matrix2[:mid, :mid]
    b12 = matrix2[:mid, mid:]
    b21 = matrix2[mid:, :mid]
    b22 = matrix2[mid:, mid:]

    m1 = strassen(a11 + a22, b11 + b22)
    m2 = strassen(a21 + a22, b11)
    m3 = strassen(a11, b12 - b22)
    m4 = strassen(a22, b21 - b11)
    m5 = strassen(a11 + a12, b22)
    m6 = strassen(a21 - a11, b11 + b12)
    m7 = strassen(a12 - a22, b21 + b22)

    c11 = m1 + m4 - m5 + m7
    c12 = m3 + m5
    c21 = m2 + m4
    c22 = m1 - m2 + m3 + m6

    return np.vstack((np.hstack((c11, c12)), np.hstack((c21, c22))))

# Example Usage:
matrix1 = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15, 16]])
matrix2 = np.array([[17, 18, 19, 20], [21, 22, 23, 24], [25, 26, 27, 28], [29, 30, 31, 32]])
result = strassen(matrix1, matrix2)
print("Result of Matrix Multiplication using Strassen's Algorithm:")
print(result)
```

**Input**: Two matrices `matrix1` and `matrix2` to be multiplied.

**Output**: The result of multiplying `matrix1` and `matrix2` using Strassen's algorithm.

**Implementation**:
1. Divide each input matrix into four submatrices of equal size.
2. Compute seven subproducts (m1 to m7) using the divide-and-conquer strategy.
3. Combine the subproducts to obtain the result matrix using formulas derived from Strassen's algorithm.

**Logic**: Strassen's algorithm reduces the number of multiplications required for matrix multiplication by dividing large matrices into smaller submatrices and performing fewer multiplications using clever formulas, leading to improved efficiency for large matrices.

**Example**: 
- **Input Matrices**:
```
Matrix1:
[[ 1,  2,  3,  4],
 [ 5,  6,  7,  8],
 [ 9, 10, 11, 12],
 [13, 14, 15, 16]]

Matrix2:
[[17, 18, 19, 20],
 [21, 22, 23, 24],
 [25, 26, 27, 28],
 [29, 30, 31, 32]]

```
- **Output (Result of Matrix Multiplication)**: 
```
[[ 250,  260,  270,  280],
 [ 618,  644,  670,  696],
 [ 986, 1028, 1070, 1112],
 [1354, 1412, 1470, 1528]]
```

**Use Case**: Strassen's algorithm is used in various fields such as computer graphics, scientific computing, and numerical simulations where efficient matrix multiplication is required, especially for large matrices.
